# Lab 6 - PWM - "Robot Motion"

# Purpose
  The point of this lab was to utilize pulse-width modulation features from the MSP430 in order to control the movement of my robot. By programming the MSP430 and generating pulse-width modulated waveforms, I was able to control both the speed and direction of the robot. The robot moved forward, backward, and did both small and large right and left turns. 
  

# Prelab
  Motor requires 12 v, and motor controller chip has 4 5v inputs and 4 12v outputs. I decided to use pins P2.0, P2.1, P2.3 and P2.5 to control the motors. Below is a schematic of how I wired the robot to the MSP430 chip.

  As shown in the schematic above, I used the four pins to control the two motors movements. 
  
  
      P2.0 controlled the right motor in reverse
      P2.1 controlled the right motor forward
      P2.3 controlled the left motor in reverse
      P2.5 controlled the left motor forward

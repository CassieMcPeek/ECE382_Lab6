# Lab 6 - PWM - "Robot Motion"

# Overview
  The point of this lab was to utilize pulse-width modulation features from the MSP430 in order to control the movement of my robot. By programming the MSP430 and generating pulse-width modulated waveforms, I was able to control both the speed and direction of the robot. The robot moved forward, backward, and did both small and large right and left turns.

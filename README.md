# Lab 6 - PWM - "Robot Motion"

# Purpose
  The point of this lab was to utilize pulse-width modulation features from the MSP430 in order to control the movement of my robot. By programming the MSP430 and generating pulse-width modulated waveforms, I was able to control both the speed and direction of the robot. The robot moved forward, backward, and did both small and large right and left turns. 
  

# Prelab
  Motor requires 12 v, and motor controller chip has 4 5v inputs and 4 12v outputs. I decided to use pins P2.0, P2.1, P2.3 and P2.5 to control the motors. Below is a schematic of how I wired the robot to the MSP430 chip.
